# <Challenge-1>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- The motivation for this project was to create a profile page on  HTML and CSS repo and make it according to the instructions. 
- I built this project in order create a custome profile page for myself to deploy it on github 
- What problem does it solve:
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

- I learned the fundamentals of HMT and CSS in this week with having a realy good grasp of how the elements and attributes fit into one another.
