# <Challenge-1>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- The motivation for this project was to take the existing HTML and CSS repo and make the requested changes to it. 
- I built this project in order to clean up the existing HTMl file and be able to deploy it on github 
- What problem does it solve:
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

- I learned the fundamentals of HMT and CSS in this week with having a realy good grasp of how the elements and attributes fit into one another.
